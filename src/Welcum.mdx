# Change in version 0.3.0 - Yeah, this plugin still not out of beta
## Rewrite frontend
- The front end being rewritten in React, tailwindcss and ShadcnUi.
- I swear the default way to create html element in Obsidian is a nightmare. React ensure the most complicate things will be easier to handle
## The Markdown processor will be changed to unifijs (which is the same engine that official Obsidian currently using) instead on MarkedJs
## Remove nuisance code in codebase, ensure the plugin will load faster.
## Improve qualities of life - of user (and more nightmares for dev):
- Allow user to edit the settings via UI instead manual write by hand.
- Allow you to cache data of each block. The block using cache will not re-compute, it just plot, this feature allow 2 things, instant plot and , frozen the state of the plot.
