Historica smart enough to work with all related time phrases like "now," "2 days ago",  
But it is also mean those related point of time always be parsed from current time from your system.  
So now you can pin a point of time as "now," also using natural language too.

Historica can even parse timezone too, just input pin_time like this "1997/Jun/12 GTM+7"?
