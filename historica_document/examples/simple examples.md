The [secession](https://www.britannica.com/topic/secession) of the Southern states (in chronological order, [South Carolina](https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Carolina/Statehood-Civil-War-and-aftermath#ref78538), [Mississippi](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mississippi-state/History#ref78491), [Florida](https://www.britannica.com/place/Florida/Statehood#ref78369), [Alabama](https://www.britannica.com/place/Alabama-state/The-Civil-War-and-its-aftermath#ref78320), [Georgia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Georgia-state/Slavery-the-Civil-War-and-Reconstruction#ref78396), [Louisiana](https://www.britannica.com/place/Louisiana-state/The-19th-century#ref78466), [Texas](https://www.britannica.com/place/Texas-state/Annexation-and-statehood#ref79046), [Virginia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Virginia-state/Independence-and-statehood#ref78585), [Arkansas](https://www.britannica.com/place/Arkansas-state/History#ref281011), [Tennessee](https://www.britannica.com/place/Tennessee/The-Civil-War-and-Reconstruction#ref78561), and [North Carolina](https://www.britannica.com/place/North-Carolina-state/The-Civil-War-and-Reconstruction#ref78514)) in 1860–61 and the ensuing outbreak of armed hostilities were the culmination of decades of growing sectional friction over [slavery](https://www.britannica.com/topic/slavery-sociology). Between 1815 and 1861 the economy of the Northern states was rapidly modernizing and diversifying. Although agriculture—mostly smaller farms that relied on free labour—remained the dominant sector in the North, industrialization had taken root there. Moreover, Northerners had invested heavily in an expansive and varied transportation system that included canals, roads, steamboats, and railroads; in financial industries such as banking and insurance; and in a large communications network that featured inexpensive, widely available newspapers, magazines, and books, along with the telegraph.

By contrast, the Southern economy was based principally on large farms (plantations) that produced commercial crops such as [cotton](https://www.britannica.com/topic/cotton-fibre-and-plant) and that relied on slaves as the main [labour force](https://www.britannica.com/money/labor-in-economics). Rather than [invest](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/invest) in factories or railroads as Northerners had done, Southerners invested their money in slaves—even more than in land; by 1860, 84 percent of the capital invested in manufacturing was invested in the free (nonslaveholding) states. Yet, to Southerners, as late as 1860, this appeared to be a sound business decision. The price of cotton, the South’s defining crop, had skyrocketed in the 1850s, and the value of slaves—who were, after all, property—rose commensurately. By 1860 the per capita wealth of Southern whites was twice that of Northerners, and three-fifths of the wealthiest individuals in the country were Southerners.
