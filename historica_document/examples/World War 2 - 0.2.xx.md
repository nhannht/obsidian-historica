**World War II**[b](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-2) or the **Second World War** (1 September 1939 – 2 September 1945) was a [global conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_war "World war") between two major alliances: the [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II") and the [Axis powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers "Axis powers"). The [vast majority of the world's countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_by_country "World War II by country"), including all the [great powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power "Great power"), fought as part of these [military alliances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_alliance "Military alliance"). Many participating countries invested all available economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities into this [total war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_war "Total war"), blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. [Aircraft played a major role](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_warfare_of_World_War_II "Air warfare of World War II"), enabling the [strategic bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing "Strategic bombing") of population centres and delivery of the [only two nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki") ever used in war. It was by far the [deadliest conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll "List of wars by death toll") in history, resulting in [70–85 million fatalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties "World War II casualties"). Millions died due to [genocides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocides "Genocides"), including [the Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust "The Holocaust"), as well as starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of Axis defeat, [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied-occupied_Germany "Allied-occupied Germany"), [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied-occupied_Austria "Allied-occupied Austria"), and [Japan were occupied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Japan "Occupation of Japan"), and [war crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_in_World_War_II "War crimes in World War II") tribunals were conducted [against German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials "Nuremberg trials") and [Japanese leaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Military_Tribunal_for_the_Far_East "International Military Tribunal for the Far East").

The [causes of the war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_World_War_II "Causes of World War II") are debated; contributing factors included the rise of [fascism in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism_in_Europe "Fascism in Europe"), the [Spanish Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War "Spanish Civil War"), the [Second Sino-Japanese War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War "Second Sino-Japanese War"), [Soviet–Japanese border conflicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_border_conflicts "Soviet–Japanese border conflicts"), and tensions in the [aftermath of World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_of_World_War_I "Aftermath of World War I"). World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany"), under [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler"), [invaded Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland "Invasion of Poland"). The [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_declaration_of_war_on_Germany_(1939) "United Kingdom declaration of war on Germany (1939)") and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_declaration_of_war_on_Germany_(1939) "French declaration of war on Germany (1939)") [declared war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war "Declaration of war") on Germany on 3 September. Under the [Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact "Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact") of August 1939, Germany and the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") had partitioned [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic "Second Polish Republic") and marked out their "[spheres of influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence "Sphere of influence")" across [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War "Winter War"), [Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Baltic_states "Occupation of the Baltic states"), and [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_occupation_of_Bessarabia_and_Northern_Bukovina "Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina"). From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of [campaigns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_campaign "Military campaign") and [treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripartite_Pact "Tripartite Pact"), Germany conquered or controlled much of [continental Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Europe "Continental Europe") in a military alliance called the Axis with [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist_Italy_(1922%E2%80%931943) "Fascist Italy (1922–1943)"), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan"), and other countries. Following the onset of campaigns in [North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Desert_campaign "Western Desert campaign") and [East Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African_campaign_(World_War_II) "East African campaign (World War II)"), and the [fall of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France "Battle of France") in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire"), with the war in the [Balkans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans_campaign_(World_War_II) "Balkans campaign (World War II)"), the aerial [Battle of Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Britain "Battle of Britain"), [the Blitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz "The Blitz") of the UK, and the [Battle of the Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic "Battle of the Atlantic"). In June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in [an invasion of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa "Operation Barbarossa"), opening the [Eastern Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II) "Eastern Front (World War II)"), the largest land [theatre of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_war "Theatre of war") in history.

Japan aimed to [dominate East Asia and the Asia-Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_East_Asia_Co-Prosperity_Sphere "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"), and by 1937 was at war with the [Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949) "Republic of China (1912–1949)"). In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous [offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_War#Japanese_offensives,_1941%E2%80%9342 "Pacific War"), including an [attack on Pearl Harbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor "Attack on Pearl Harbor") which resulted in the United States and the United Kingdom declaring war against Japan. The [European Axis powers declared war on the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_declaration_of_war_against_the_United_States "German declaration of war against the United States") in solidarity. [Japan soon conquered much of the western Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_War "Pacific War"), but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical [Battle of Midway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Midway "Battle of Midway"); Germany and Italy were [defeated in North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian_campaign "Tunisian campaign") and at [Stalingrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad "Battle of Stalingrad") in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943—including German defeats on the Eastern Front, the [Allied invasions of Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_invasion_of_Sicily "Allied invasion of Sicily") and the [Italian mainland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_invasion_of_Italy "Allied invasion of Italy"), and Allied offensives in the Pacific—cost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies [invaded German-occupied France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings "Normandy landings"), while the Soviet Union [regained its territorial losses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalin%27s_ten_blows "Stalin's ten blows") and pushed Germany and its allies back. During 1944–1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the [Japanese Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy "Imperial Japanese Navy") and captured key western Pacific islands. The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of [German-occupied territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-occupied_Europe "German-occupied Europe"); the [invasion of Germany by the Western Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Allied_invasion_of_Germany "Western Allied invasion of Germany") and the Soviet Union, culminating in the [Fall of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Berlin "Battle of Berlin") to Soviet troops; [Hitler's suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Adolf_Hitler "Death of Adolf Hitler"); and the German [unconditional surrender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Instrument_of_Surrender "German Instrument of Surrender") on [8 May 1945](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day "Victory in Europe Day"). Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the [Potsdam Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam_Declaration "Potsdam Declaration"), the US [dropped the first atomic bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki") on [Hiroshima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima "Hiroshima") on 6 August and [Nagasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasaki "Nagasaki") on 9 August. Faced with imminent [invasion of the Japanese archipelago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Downfall "Operation Downfall"), the possibility of more atomic bombings, and the Soviet Union's [declared entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_War "Soviet–Japanese War") into the war against Japan on the eve of [invading Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria "Soviet invasion of Manchuria"), Japan announced on 10 August its intention to surrender, signing [a surrender document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Instrument_of_Surrender "Japanese Instrument of Surrender") on [2 September 1945](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_over_Japan_Day "Victory over Japan Day").

World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the world, and it set the foundation for the international order for the rest of the 20th century and into the 21st century. The [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") was established to foster international cooperation and prevent conflicts, with the victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the US—becoming the [permanent members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council "Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council") of its [Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council "United Nations Security Council"). The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival [superpowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower "Superpower"), setting the stage for the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War"). In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the [decolonisation of Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonisation_of_Africa "Decolonisation of Africa") and [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonisation_of_Asia "Decolonisation of Asia"). Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards [economic recovery and expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%E2%80%93World_War_II_economic_expansion "Post–World War II economic expansion").

World War II began in Europe on 1 September 1939[1](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWeinberg20056-3) [2](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-4) with the [German invasion of Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_invasion_of_Poland "German invasion of Poland") and the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_declaration_of_war_on_Germany_(1939) "United Kingdom declaration of war on Germany (1939)") and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_declaration_of_war_on_Germany_(1939) "French declaration of war on Germany (1939)")'s declaration of war on Germany two days later on 3 September 1939. Dates for the beginning of the [Pacific War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_War "Pacific War") include the start of the [Second Sino-Japanese War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War "Second Sino-Japanese War") on 7 July 1937,[3](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-5) [4](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEF%C3%B6rsterGessler200564-6) or the earlier [Japanese invasion of Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria "Japanese invasion of Manchuria"), on 19 September 1931.[5](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-7) [6](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-8) Others follow the British historian [A. J. P. Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._P._Taylor "A. J. P. Taylor"), who stated that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars became World War II in 1941.[7](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-9) Other theorised starting dates for World War II include the [Italian invasion of Abyssinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War "Second Italo-Ethiopian War") on 3 October 1935.[8](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-10) The British historian [Antony Beevor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Beevor "Antony Beevor") views the beginning of World War II as the [Battles of Khalkhin Gol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Khalkhin_Gol "Battles of Khalkhin Gol") fought between [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan") and the forces of [Mongolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_People%27s_Republic "Mongolian People's Republic") and the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") from May to September 1939.[9](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBeevor201210-11) Others view the [Spanish Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War "Spanish Civil War") as the start or prelude to World War II.[10](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-12) [11](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-13)

The exact date of the war's end also is not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 15 August 1945 ([V-J Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_over_Japan_Day "Victory over Japan Day")), rather than with the formal [surrender of Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan "Surrender of Japan") on 2 September 1945, which officially [ended the war in Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Asia "End of World War II in Asia"). A [peace treaty between Japan and the Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_San_Francisco "Treaty of San Francisco") was signed in 1951.[12](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMasaya19904-14) A 1990 [treaty regarding Germany's future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Final_Settlement_with_Respect_to_Germany "Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany") allowed the [reunification of East and West Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification "German reunification") to take place and resolved most post–World War II issues.[13](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-15) No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever signed,[14](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-16) although the state of war between the two countries was terminated by the [Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_Joint_Declaration_of_1956 "Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956"), which also restored full diplomatic relations between them.[15](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-nyt-17)

The [League of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations "League of Nations") assembly, held in [Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva "Geneva"), [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland") (1930).

[World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") had radically altered the political European map with the defeat of the [Central Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Powers "Central Powers")—including [Austria-Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary "Austria-Hungary"), [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire "German Empire"), [Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Bulgaria "Kingdom of Bulgaria"), and the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire")—and the 1917 [Bolshevik seizure of power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution "October Revolution") in [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Republic "Russian Republic"), which led to the founding of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the victorious [Allies of World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I "Allies of World War I"), such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Greece, gained territory, and new [nation-states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_state "Nation state") were created out of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian Empires.[16](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-18)

To prevent a future world war, the [League of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations "League of Nations") was established in 1920 by the [Paris Peace Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference_(1919%E2%80%931920) "Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)"). The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security, military, and [naval disarmament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Naval_Treaty "Washington Naval Treaty"), as well as settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.[17](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-19)

Despite strong pacifist sentiment [after World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_of_World_War_I "Aftermath of World War I"),[18](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIngram2006[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidbREQibN9i-sCpgPA76_76%E2%80%9378]-20) [irredentist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irredentism "Irredentism") and [revanchist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revanchism "Revanchism") [nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism "Nationalism") had emerged in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses imposed by the [Treaty of Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles "Treaty of Versailles"). Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all [its overseas possessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_colonial_empire "German colonial empire"), while German annexation of other states was prohibited, [reparations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_reparations "World War I reparations") were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's [armed forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichswehr "Reichswehr").[19](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKantowicz1999149-21)

#### Germany

The German Empire was dissolved in the [German Revolution of 1918–1919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Revolution_of_1918%E2%80%931919 "German Revolution of 1918–1919"), and a democratic government, later known as the [Weimar Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic "Weimar Republic"), was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the political right and left. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the [promises made](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_London_(1915) "Treaty of London (1915)") by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the [Fascist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_fascism "Italian fascism") movement led by [Benito Mussolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini "Benito Mussolini") seized power in Italy with a nationalist, [totalitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism "Totalitarianism"), and [class collaborationist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_collaboration "Class collaboration") agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing, and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a world power, promising the creation of a "[New Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Roman_Empire "New Roman Empire")".[20](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShaw200035-22)

[Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler"), after an [unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch "Beer Hall Putsch") in 1923, eventually [became the Chancellor of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler%27s_rise_to_power "Adolf Hitler's rise to power") in 1933 when [Paul von Hindenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_von_Hindenburg "Paul von Hindenburg") and the Reichstag appointed him. Following Hindenburg's death in 1934, Hitler proclaimed himself _Führer_ of Germany and abolished democracy, espousing a [radical, racially motivated revision of the world order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Order_(Nazism) "New Order (Nazism)"), and soon began a massive [rearmament campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_rearmament "German rearmament").[21](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrody19994-23) France, seeking to secure its alliance with Italy, [allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Italian_Agreement_of_1935 "Franco-Italian Agreement of 1935"), which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the [Territory of the Saar Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_the_Saar_Basin "Territory of the Saar Basin") was legally reunited with Germany, and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription.[22](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEZalampas198962-24)

The United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the [Stresa Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stresa_Front "Stresa Front") in April 1935 in order to contain Germany, a key step towards [military globalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_globalization "Military globalization"); however, that June, the United Kingdom made an [independent naval agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-German_Naval_Agreement "Anglo-German Naval Agreement") with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by Germany's [goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drang_nach_Osten "Drang nach Osten"), drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect, though, the [Franco-Soviet pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Soviet_Treaty_of_Mutual_Assistance "Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance") was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.[23](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-25) The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the [Neutrality Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrality_Acts_of_the_1930s "Neutrality Acts of the 1930s") in August of the same year.[24](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchmitz2000124-26)

Hitler defied the Versailles and [Locarno Treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locarno_Treaties "Locarno Treaties") by [remilitarising the Rhineland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remilitarisation_of_the_Rhineland "Remilitarisation of the Rhineland") in March 1936, encountering little opposition due to the policy of [appeasement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement "Appeasement").[25](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAdamthwaite199252-27) In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the [Rome–Berlin Axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers "Axis powers"). A month later, Germany and Japan signed the [Anti-Comintern Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Comintern_Pact "Anti-Comintern Pact"), which Italy joined the following year.[26](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShirer1990298%E2%80%93299-28)

#### Asia

The [Kuomintang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuomintang "Kuomintang") (KMT) party in China launched a [unification campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Expedition "Northern Expedition") against [regional warlords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord_Era "Warlord Era") and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in [a civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War "Chinese Civil War") against its former [Chinese Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party "Chinese Communist Party") allies[27](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPreston1998104-29) and [new regional warlords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Plains_War "Central Plains War"). In 1931, an [increasingly militaristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statism_in_Sh%C5%8Dwa_Japan "Statism in Shōwa Japan") [Empire of Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan"), which had long sought influence in China[28](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMyersPeattie1987458-30) as the first step of what its government saw as the country's [right to rule Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakk%C5%8D_ichiu "Hakkō ichiu"), staged the [Mukden incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukden_incident "Mukden incident") as a pretext to [invade Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria "Japanese invasion of Manchuria") and establish the [puppet state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_state "Puppet state") of [Manchukuo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchukuo "Manchukuo").[29](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmithSteadman200428-31)

China appealed to the [League of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations "League of Nations") to stop the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being [condemned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytton_Report "Lytton Report") for its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in [Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_28_incident "January 28 incident"), [Rehe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Rehe "Battle of Rehe") and [Hebei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_the_Great_Wall "Defense of the Great Wall"), until the [Tanggu Truce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanggu_Truce "Tanggu Truce") was signed in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in [Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacification_of_Manchukuo "Pacification of Manchukuo"), and [Chahar and Suiyuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actions_in_Inner_Mongolia_(1933%E2%80%931936) "Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933–1936)").[30](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-32) After the 1936 [Xi'an Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an_Incident "Xi'an Incident"), the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present [a united front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_United_Front "Second United Front") to oppose Japan.[31](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBusky200210-33)

The [Second Italo-Ethiopian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War "Second Italo-Ethiopian War") was a brief [colonial war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_war "Colonial war") that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the invasion of the [Ethiopian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Empire "Ethiopian Empire") (also known as [Abyssinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology_of_Ethiopia "Etymology of Ethiopia")) by the armed forces of the [Kingdom of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy "Kingdom of Italy") (_Regno d'Italia_), which was launched from [Italian Somaliland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Somaliland "Italian Somaliland") and [Eritrea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Eritrea "Italian Eritrea").[32](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-34) The war resulted in the [military occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation "Military occupation") of Ethiopia and its [annexation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation "Annexation") into the newly created colony of [Italian East Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_East_Africa "Italian East Africa") (_Africa Orientale Italiana_, or AOI); in addition it exposed the weakness of the [League of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations "League of Nations") as a force to preserve peace. Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, [but the League did little](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement "Appeasement") when the former clearly violated Article X of the League's [Covenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_of_the_League_of_Nations "Covenant of the League of Nations").[33](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBarker1971131%E2%80%93132-35) The United Kingdom and France supported imposing sanctions on Italy for the invasion, but the sanctions were not fully enforced and failed to end the Italian invasion.[34](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShirer1990289-36) Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_State_of_Austria "Federal State of Austria").[35](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKitson2001231-37)

#### Spanish Civil War (1936–1939)

Main article: [Spanish Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War "Spanish Civil War")

When civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the [Nationalist rebels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_faction_(Spanish_Civil_War) "Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)"), led by General [Francisco Franco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco "Francisco Franco"). Italy supported the Nationalists to a greater extent than the Nazis: Mussolini sent more than 70,000 ground troops, 6,000 aviation personnel, and 720 aircraft to Spain.[36](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTENeulen200025-38) The Soviet Union supported the existing government of the [Spanish Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic "Second Spanish Republic"). More than 30,000 foreign volunteers, known as the [International Brigades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Brigades "International Brigades"), also fought against the Nationalists. Both Germany and the Soviet Union used this [proxy war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war "Proxy war") as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939; Franco, now dictator, remained officially neutral during World War II but [generally favoured the Axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_during_World_War_II "Spain during World War II").[37](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPayne2008271-39) His greatest collaboration with Germany was the sending of [volunteers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Division "Blue Division") to fight on the [Eastern Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II) "Eastern Front (World War II)").[38](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPayne2008146-40)

In July 1937, Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of [Peking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing "Beijing") after instigating the [Marco Polo Bridge incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo_Bridge_incident "Marco Polo Bridge incident"), which culminated in the Japanese campaign to invade all of China.[39](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEastman1986547%E2%80%93551-41) The Soviets quickly signed a [non-aggression pact with China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_Non-Aggression_Pact "Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact") to lend [materiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materiel "Materiel") support, effectively ending China's prior [cooperation with Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93Germany_relations_(1912%E2%80%931949) "China–Germany relations (1912–1949)"). From September to November, the Japanese attacked [Taiyuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Taiyuan "Battle of Taiyuan"), engaged the [Kuomintang Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Revolutionary_Army "National Revolutionary Army") [around Xinkou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Xinkou "Battle of Xinkou"),[40](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-Hsu_&_Chang_1971_221-42) and fought [Communist forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party "Chinese Communist Party") [in Pingxingguan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pingxingguan "Battle of Pingxingguan").[41](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-Tucker2009-43) [42](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-yang-44) [Generalissimo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalissimo "Generalissimo") [Chiang Kai-shek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek "Chiang Kai-shek") deployed his [best army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German-trained_divisions_of_the_National_Revolutionary_Army "List of German-trained divisions of the National Revolutionary Army") to [defend Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shanghai "Battle of Shanghai"), but after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push Chinese forces back, [capturing the capital Nanking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nanking "Battle of Nanking") in December 1937. After the fall of Nanking, tens or hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were [murdered by the Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Massacre "Nanjing Massacre").[43](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-45) [44](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-tot-46)

In March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces won their [first major victory at Taierzhuang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Taierzhuang "Battle of Taierzhuang"), but then the city of [Xuzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuzhou "Xuzhou") [was taken by the Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Xuzhou "Battle of Xuzhou") in May.[45](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHsuChang1971221%E2%80%93230-47) In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by [flooding the Yellow River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_Yellow_River_flood "1938 Yellow River flood"); this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at [Wuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan "Wuhan"), but the [city was taken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Wuhan "Battle of Wuhan") by October.[46](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEastman1986566-48) Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve; instead, the Chinese government relocated inland to [Chongqing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing "Chongqing") and continued the war.[47](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTETaylor2009150%E2%80%93152-49) [48](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTESella1983651%E2%80%93687-50)

#### Soviet–Japanese border conflicts

Main article: [Soviet–Japanese border conflicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_border_conflicts "Soviet–Japanese border conflicts")

In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in [Manchukuo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchukuo "Manchukuo") had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and [Mongolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_People%27s_Republic "Mongolian People's Republic"). The Japanese doctrine of [Hokushin-ron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokushin-ron "Hokushin-ron"), which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. This policy would prove difficult to maintain in light of the Japanese defeat at [Khalkin Gol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Khalkhin_Gol "Battles of Khalkhin Gol") in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War[49](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBeevor2012342-51) and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a [Neutrality Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_Neutrality_Pact "Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact") in April 1941, and Japan adopted the doctrine of [Nanshin-ron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanshin-ron "Nanshin-ron"), promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward and eventually led to war with the United States and the Western Allies.[50](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-52) [51](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-53)

In Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive. In March 1938, Germany [annexed Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss "Anschluss"), again provoking [little response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement "Appeasement") from other European powers.[52](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTECollierPedley2000144-54) Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the [Sudetenland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudetenland "Sudetenland"), an area of [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia "Czechoslovakia") with a predominantly [ethnic German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans "Germans") population. Soon the United Kingdom and France followed the appeasement policy of British Prime Minister [Neville Chamberlain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neville_Chamberlain "Neville Chamberlain") and conceded this territory to Germany in the [Munich Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement "Munich Agreement"), which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands.[53](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKershaw2001121%E2%80%93122-55) Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to [cede additional territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Vienna_Award "First Vienna Award") to Hungary, and Poland annexed the [Trans-Olza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Olza "Trans-Olza") region of Czechoslovakia.[54](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKershaw2001157-56)

Although all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement, privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation. In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish "war-mongers" and in January 1939 [secretly ordered a major build-up of the German navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_Z "Plan Z") to challenge British naval supremacy. In March 1939, [Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Czechoslovakia_(1938%E2%80%931945) "Occupation of Czechoslovakia (1938–1945)") and subsequently split it into the German [Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectorate_of_Bohemia_and_Moravia "Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia") and a pro-German [client state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_state "Client state"), the [Slovak Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_Republic_(1939%E2%80%931945) "Slovak Republic (1939–1945)").[55](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavies2006pp._143%E2%80%9344_(2008_ed.)-57) Hitler also delivered an [ultimatum to Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_German_ultimatum_to_Lithuania "1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania") on 20 March 1939, forcing the concession of the [Klaipėda Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaip%C4%97da_Region "Klaipėda Region"), formerly the German _Memelland_.[56](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShirer1990461%E2%80%93462-58)

Greatly alarmed and with Hitler making further demands on the [Free City of Danzig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_City_of_Danzig "Free City of Danzig"), the United Kingdom and France [guaranteed their support for Polish independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Polish_alliance#British_assurance_to_Poland "Anglo-Polish alliance"); when [Italy conquered Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_invasion_of_Albania "Italian invasion of Albania") in April 1939, the same guarantee was extended to the [Kingdoms of Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Romania "Kingdom of Romania") and [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Greece "Kingdom of Greece").[57](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTELoweMarzari2002330-59) Shortly after the [Franco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Polish_alliance "Franco-Polish alliance")-[British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Polish_alliance "Anglo-Polish alliance") pledge to Poland, Germany and Italy formalised their own alliance with the [Pact of Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pact_of_Steel "Pact of Steel").[58](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDearFoot2001234-60) Hitler accused the United Kingdom and Poland of trying to "encircle" Germany and renounced the [Anglo-German Naval Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-German_Naval_Agreement "Anglo-German Naval Agreement") and the [German–Polish declaration of non-aggression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%E2%80%93Polish_declaration_of_non-aggression "German–Polish declaration of non-aggression").[59](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShirer1990471-61)

The situation became a crisis in late August as German troops continued to mobilise against the Polish border. On 23 August the Soviet Union signed [a non-aggression pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact "Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact") with Germany,[60](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShore2003108-62) after tripartite negotiations for a military alliance between France, the United Kingdom, and Soviet Union had stalled.[61](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-63) This pact had a secret protocol that defined German and Soviet "spheres of influence" (western [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic "Second Polish Republic") and Lithuania for Germany; [eastern Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territories_of_Poland_annexed_by_the_Soviet_Union "Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union"), Finland, [Estonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia "Estonia"), [Latvia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia "Latvia") and [Bessarabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessarabia "Bessarabia") for the Soviet Union), and raised the question of continuing Polish independence.[62](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDearFoot2001608-64) The pact neutralised the possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland and assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in World War I. Immediately afterwards, Hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August, but upon hearing that the United Kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland and that Italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it.[63](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-65)

In response to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, Germany made demands on Poland, which served as a pretext to worsen relations.[64](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-ww2db_com-66) On 29 August, Hitler demanded that a Polish [plenipotentiary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plenipotentiary "Plenipotentiary") immediately travel to Berlin to negotiate the handover of [Danzig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk "Gdańsk"), and to allow a [plebiscite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum "Referendum") in the [Polish Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Corridor "Polish Corridor") in which the German minority would vote on secession.[64](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-ww2db_com-66) The Poles refused to comply with the German demands, and on the night of 30–31 August in a confrontational meeting with the British ambassador [Nevile Henderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevile_Henderson "Nevile Henderson"), Ribbentrop declared that Germany considered its claims rejected.[65](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-ibiblio1939-67)

On 1 September 1939, Germany [invaded Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland "Invasion of Poland") after [having staged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Himmler "Operation Himmler") several [false flag border incidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleiwitz_incident "Gleiwitz incident") as a pretext to initiate the invasion.[66](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEvans20081%E2%80%932-68) The first German attack of the war came against the [Polish defenses at Westerplatte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Westerplatte "Battle of Westerplatte").[67](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-Zabecki2015-69) The United Kingdom responded with an ultimatum for Germany to cease military operations, and on 3 September, after the ultimatum was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany,[68](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-70) followed by [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia"), [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_of_New_Zealand "Dominion of New Zealand"), [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_South_Africa "Union of South Africa"), and [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"). During the [Phoney War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoney_War "Phoney War") period, the alliance provided no direct military support to Poland, outside of a [cautious French probe into the Saarland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saar_Offensive "Saar Offensive").[69](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-Keegan_1997_35-71) The Western Allies also began a [naval blockade of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Germany_(1939%E2%80%931945) "Blockade of Germany (1939–1945)"), which aimed to damage the country's economy and war effort.[70](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-72) Germany responded by ordering [U-boat warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_warfare#World_War_II "Submarine warfare") against Allied merchant and warships, which would later escalate into the [Battle of the Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic "Battle of the Atlantic").[71](read://https_en.wikipedia.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWorld_War_II#cite_note-73)

On 8 September, German troops reached the suburbs of [Warsaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw "Warsaw"). The Polish [counter-offensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bzura "Battle of the Bzura") to the west halted the German advance for several days, but it was outflanked and encircled by the _[Wehrmacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht "Wehrmacht")_. Remnants of the Polish army broke through to [besieged Warsaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Warsaw_(1939) "Siege of Warsaw (1939)").
