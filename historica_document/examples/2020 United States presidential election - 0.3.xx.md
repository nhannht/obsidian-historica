The **2020 United States presidential election** was the 59th quadrennial [presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election "United States presidential election"), held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-ElectionDay-1) The [Democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States) "Democratic Party (United States)") ticket of former [vice president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States "Vice President of the United States") [Joe Biden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden") and the junior [U.S. senator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._senator "U.S. senator") from [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "California") [Kamala Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris "Kamala Harris") defeated the incumbent [Republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States) "Republican Party (United States)") [president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States"), [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump"), and [vice president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States "Vice President of the United States"), [Mike Pence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence "Mike Pence").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-12) The election took place against the backdrop of the global [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States "COVID-19 pandemic in the United States") and [related recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_recession "COVID-19 recession"). The election saw the highest [voter turnout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_United_States_presidential_elections "Voter turnout in United States presidential elections") by percentage [since 1900](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1900_United_States_presidential_election "1900 United States presidential election"). Biden received more than 81 million votes,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-:7-13) the [most votes ever cast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_candidates_by_number_of_votes_received "List of United States presidential candidates by number of votes received") for a candidate in a U.S. presidential election.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-:8-14)

In a competitive primary that featured the most candidates for any political party in the [modern era of American politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Party_System "Sixth Party System"), Biden secured the [Democratic presidential nomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"). Biden's running mate, Harris, became the first African-American, first Asian-American, and third female[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-15) vice presidential nominee on a major party ticket. Trump secured re-nomination, getting a total of 2,549 delegates, one of the most in [presidential primary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_primary "United States presidential primary") history, in the [Republican primaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries "2020 Republican Party presidential primaries").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-16) [Jo Jorgensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Jorgensen "Jo Jorgensen") secured the [Libertarian presidential nomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Libertarian_Party_presidential_primaries "2020 Libertarian Party presidential primaries") with [Spike Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Cohen "Spike Cohen") as her running mate, and [Howie Hawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howie_Hawkins "Howie Hawkins") secured the [Green presidential nomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Green_Party_presidential_primaries "2020 Green Party presidential primaries") with [Angela Nicole Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Nicole_Walker "Angela Nicole Walker") as his running mate.

The central issues of the election included the public health and [economic impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States "Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States"); [civil unrest in reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests "George Floyd protests") to the police [murder of George Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd "Murder of George Floyd") and others; the [Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States "Supreme Court of the United States") following the [death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_and_state_funeral_of_Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg "Death and state funeral of Ruth Bader Ginsburg") and [confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Coney_Barrett_Supreme_Court_nomination "Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court nomination"); and the future of the [Affordable Care Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act "Affordable Care Act").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-17) Due to the ongoing pandemic, a record number of ballots were [cast early](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_voting "Early voting") and [by mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_voting "Postal voting").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-:9-18) Thirty-eight states had over half of all votes cast using these methods, and only three states had fewer than 25%.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-19)

Many more registered Democrats voted by mail than registered Republicans.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-20)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-21) As a result of a large number of mail-in ballots, some [swing states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state "Swing state") saw delays in vote counting and reporting; this led to major news outlets delaying their projection of Biden and Harris as the [president-elect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_transition_of_Joe_Biden "Presidential transition of Joe Biden") and [vice president-elect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president-elect_of_the_United_States "Vice president-elect of the United States") until the morning of November 7. Major media networks project a state for a candidate once there is high statistical confidence that the outstanding vote would be unlikely to prevent the projected winner from ultimately winning that state.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-math-22)

Biden ultimately received the majority in the [Electoral College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College "United States Electoral College") with 306 electoral votes, while Trump received 232. Trump was the first president to lose re-election since [George H. W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush "George H. W. Bush") in [1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_United_States_presidential_election "1992 United States presidential election"). Key to Biden's victory were his wins in the Democratic-leaning [Rust Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_Belt "Rust Belt") states of [Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Michigan "2020 United States presidential election in Michigan"), [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Pennsylvania "2020 United States presidential election in Pennsylvania"), and [Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Wisconsin "2020 United States presidential election in Wisconsin"), which Trump narrowly carried in 2016 and whose combined 46 electoral votes were enough to swing the election to either candidate. Biden also became the first Democrat to win a presidential election in [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Georgia "2020 United States presidential election in Georgia") since [1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_United_States_presidential_election_in_Georgia "1992 United States presidential election in Georgia") and in [Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Arizona "2020 United States presidential election in Arizona") since [1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_United_States_presidential_election_in_Arizona "1996 United States presidential election in Arizona"), as well as [Nebraska's 2nd congressional district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Nebraska "2020 United States presidential election in Nebraska") since [2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election_in_Nebraska "2008 United States presidential election in Nebraska").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-autogenerated1-23)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-24) Before, during, and after Election Day, Trump and numerous other Republicans engaged in an aggressive and unprecedented[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-25) [attempt to subvert the election and overturn the results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"),[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-NYT-20230808-26) falsely alleging widespread [voter fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud "Electoral fraud") and trying to influence the vote-counting process in swing states[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-27) in what has been described as an attempted [self-coup d'état](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup "Self-coup").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-Multiple_Sources-28)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-coup-bundle-29) Attorney General [William Barr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr "William Barr") and officials in each of the 50 states found no evidence of widespread fraud or irregularities in the election.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-30)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-NY_Times_Officials-31) Federal agencies overseeing election security said it was the most secure in American history.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-32)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-Statement-33)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-34) The Trump campaign and its allies, including Republican members of [Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress"),[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-35) continued to engage in numerous attempts to overturn the results of the election by [filing numerous lawsuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-election_lawsuits_related_to_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election "Post-election lawsuits related to the 2020 United States presidential election") in several states (most of which were withdrawn or dismissed),[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-36) spreading conspiracy theories alleging fraud,[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-37) pressuring Republican state election officials (including, notably, Georgia Secretary of State [Brad Raffensperger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Raffensperger "Brad Raffensperger"), in [a phone call that later became widely publicized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Raffensperger_phone_call "Trump–Raffensperger phone call")) and legislators to change results,[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-WaPo_Georgia_call-38) pressuring the [Department of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice "United States Department of Justice") to declare the election "corrupt" and

to the [Electoral College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College "United States Electoral College") certification in Congress,[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-41)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-42) and

Biden").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#cite_note-coup-bundle-29) With Trump vowing that he would never concede the election and after exhorting his followers to "fight like hell", a mob of Trump supporters [attacked the United States Capitol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack "January 6 United States Capitol
